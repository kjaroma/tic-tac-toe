## Missing parts:
- Use Zod schema for configuration validation,
- Improve Websocket client verification using callback,
- Better game handling,
- Validate user inputs on auth endpoints,
- Use Redis to store game partials
- Make game generic on game create
- Implement web application


## Description:

Your objective is to create a web application for the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring a login mechanism and online game initiation. The aim is to deliver a user-friendly and engaging Tic-Tac-Toe experience.
